* 1Password.el
This is an alpha implementation of integration with the 1Password CLI.
** Setup
- make sure you have 1Password CLI installed

** Features
- [X] auth-source integration for searching by title or id
- [X] Interactive commands based on `op items` commands
  - [X] op item list
  - [X] op item get password
  - [X] op item create
  - [X] op item delete
  - [X] op item share
- [ ] generate password command
** Dev TODO
- better handle situations where json module isn't guaranteed
- make an async version execute in buffer
** Auth Source
It's important to remember that auth-source's default behaviour is to cache items for 7200 seconds. So, if you don't like your secrets sticking around in memory set ~auth-source-do-source~ to nil or ~auth-source-cache-expiry~ to a lower threshold.

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package 1password
 :elpaca  (1password :host github :repo "justinbarclay/1password.el" :branch "main")
 :init
 (1password-enable-auth-source))
#+end_src

This will add a new auth-source backend ~1password~ that let's you query for things normally:
#+begin_src elisp :results code
 (auth-source-search :host "api.github.com")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src elisp
(:backend 1password :host "api.github.com" :username "githubapi@github.com" :secret "JMH73PktuQK4eCPAvPvc")
#+end_src

Or if you want to query only from 1Password
#+begin_src elisp :results code
 (auth-source-search :type '1password :host "api.github.com")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src elisp
(:backend 1password :host "api.github.com" :username "githubapi@justinbarclay.ca" :secret "JMH73PktuQK4eCPAvPvc")
#+end_src
